# Meower Server
The source code behind the Meower API, written in Python.

> [!NOTE]
> The Meower API right now is sorta-maintained.
> In the future, we plan on rewriting the API for v1 and the socket for v2, both of which will be in a different repo.

## Running the server

```py
git clone https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Server.git
cd Meower-Server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
